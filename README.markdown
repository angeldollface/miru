# MIRU :unicorn: :ribbon:

## ABOUT :books:

Since I like microservices and APIs, I decided to write my own tiny library for my fellow crabs bringing them the functionality they need to implement microservices in a light(-hearted) way. This repository contains the source code for this library, ***Miru***. Also, there was too much drama around Actix Web. If you know, you know. An example can be found in the `examples` directory.

## STATUS :warning:

***THIS PROJECT IS STILL HEAVILY WORK IN PROGRESS!***
